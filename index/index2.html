      <br>
      <br>

      For decades, Three Star Restaurant in Brooklyn has delighted diners with its interpretation of classic American and

      <br>
      <br>
      Greek plates for breakfast, lunch and dinner in its casual and relaxed setting. If you stop by Three Star Restaurant for
      <br><br>
      breakfast, you can enjoy such hearty and fresh offerings as the Spanish omelette, the chocolate chip pancakes with
      <br><br>
      Canadian bacon and the corned beef hash and two eggs.
      <br><br>
      Some of Three Star's specialty entr√©e dishes include the broiled stuffed whole baby founder filled with crabmeat, feta and
      <br><br>
      spinach, the Virginia ham steak with pineapple ring, the famous spinach pie with Greek salad, and the chicken
      <br><br>
      francaise over rice. Handhelds, like the open grilled cheese with bacon and tomato, and the mayo-free healthy tuna
      <br><br>
      wrap are excellent choices for lunch.
      <br><br>
      End your meal on a sweet note with Three Star Restaurant's apple turnover and a hot and frothy cappuccino.</p>
